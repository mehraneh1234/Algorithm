# Algorithm
Create a program in Python that meets the following criteria:
1.	Contains a Tuple data structure with the data in the table below.
2.	Contains a method for doing a linear search of the data structure. This linear search method should return the index of the value.
3.	The string searched for should be taken from user input using the input() function.
4.	The code should call the search method and successfully demonstrate your linear search works.
5.	Your application must demonstrate use of the type() Python library function to output to the console the type of the data structure you have chosen to use (Tuple.)
6.	Your code must be in a file called algorithm.py
